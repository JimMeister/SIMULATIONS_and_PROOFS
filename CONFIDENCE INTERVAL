#The filling machine used by a dairy company to fill 1kg containers of yoghurt produces output which follows a 
#normal distribution with mean 1030g (slightly more than 1kg) and standard deviation 20g.
#Suppose that the company can change either the mean or the standard deviation of the filling amount (but not both).
#If they require the probability of underfilling a container (i.e. contents less than 1000g) to equal 0.05, 
#find (i) the smallest value of the mean; and (ii) the largest value of the standard deviation 
#that satisfies this requirement (in each case to the nearest gram).


mean <- 1030
p <- 0.05
lower <- 1000

# mean - qnorm(0.95) * SD = 1,000

# hence, SD = (lower - mean) /  - qnorm(0.9))


SD <- (lower - mean) / - qnorm(0.95)

SD

#[1] 18.2387

#Proof:

qnorm(p, mean, SD)


#[1] 1000


#For the minimal mean with a given SD of 20:

SD <- 20

# mean = 1,000 + qnorm(0.95) * SD

min_mean <- lower + qnorm(0.95) * SD

min_mean

#[1] 967.1029

qnorm(p, min_mean, SD)

#[1] 1000
